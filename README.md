![Poultry Shield Logo](path_to_logo_image) *(Optional: Add a logo or image related to the project)*

## Overview

Poultry Shield is a deep learning-based application designed to assist in the early diagnosis of Coccidiosis in poultry, a prevalent parasitic disease that affects poultry health and productivity. This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify signs of Coccidiosis from poultry images, enabling timely interventions and reducing potential losses in poultry farming.

## Project Motivation

Coccidiosis is a significant concern in the poultry industry, leading to substantial economic losses. Early and accurate diagnosis can help in better management and treatment, ensuring the health and productivity of poultry. Poultry Shield aims to provide a reliable tool for detecting Coccidiosis using deep learning models, contributing to more effective disease management practices.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a pre-trained VGG16 model fine-tuned for the task of Coccidiosis detection.
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline:** Efficiently handles data downloading, preprocessing, and augmentation.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Robust training pipeline with model checkpointing and evaluation metrics.
- **Web Interface:** *(Optional)* A simple web interface for uploading images and getting predictions.
- **DVC Integration:** Track experiments and manage datasets using Data Version Control (DVC).
- **Modular Codebase:** Easy to extend and adapt for other similar applications.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](path_to_architecture_diagram)

The architecture consists of the following stages:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Download and prepare the dataset.
2. **Model Preparation:** Fine-tune the VGG16 model for Coccidiosis detection.
3. **Training:** Train the model with the preprocessed data.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance on the validation set.

## Installation

To get started with the Poultry Shield project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shahriyar31/Poultry_Shield-Deep-Learning-for-Poultry-Coccidiosis-Diagnosis.git
   cd Poultry_Shield-Deep-Learning-for-Poultry-Coccidiosis-Diagnosis
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure DVC**
   ```bash
   dvc pull
   ```

5. **Set Up Configuration Files**
   Ensure the `config.yaml` and `params.yaml` files are correctly configured for your environment.

## Usage

To run the different stages of the pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion**
   ```bash
   python src/Poultry_Shield/pipeline/stage_01_data_ingestion.py
   ```

2. **Prepare Base Model**
   ```bash
   python src/Poultry_Shield/pipeline/stage_02_prepare_base_model.py
   ```

3. **Training**
   ```bash
   python src/Poultry_Shield/pipeline/stage_03_training.py
   ```

4. **Evaluation**
   ```bash
   python src/Poultry_Shield/pipeline/stage_04_evaluation.py
   ```

To use the web interface:

```bash
flask run
```
